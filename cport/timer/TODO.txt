### IMPROVEMENTS

1. Think of passing timer implementation as template parameter
2. Think of calling callback in try/catch block to catch std::bad_function_call exception and remove the timer if occurs.
3. Fix the spelling error in countdown_timer::start() method.
4. Check if there is a test case for completion_handler_wrapper where an exception is thrown if the handler is called more than once

### BUGS
1. Countdown will not finish on time if the interval is not multiple of duration
2. There is a race condition if the service is destroyed while there are active timers
